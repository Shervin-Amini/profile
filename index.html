<h1> Hello, I'm Amnesiac, call me John Doe.</h1>
  <p id="recall"> As I said, I'm amnesiac, so I don't know or remember anything about my old life.</p>
    <p id="monologue"> Well, erm ... old ... <br>
    By that I'm potentially assuming I had a life, and as you must know, most of us don't actually live, but merely exist.<br>
    Hopefully it was a little different for me, but does it really matter ? <br>
    If I actually only 'existed', would people actually miss me ? <br>
    Isn't this a chance at an actual, fulfilled life ?<br>
    And if so, am I destined to rebuild the same life I previously lived or can I still capitalize on the idealistic notion of free-will to build a life of wonder, risk and adventure ?<br>
    I digress, I am sorry.<br> <br>
    As  I said, I'm amnesiac, so I don't know or remember anything about my 'old' life.<br> <br>
    Yours, <br>
    John</p>
